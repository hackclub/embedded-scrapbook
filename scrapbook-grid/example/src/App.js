truck fighting wildfires :firefighter: (it’s still boiling from the heater and it intentionally smells of burning) and to end of your experience a cyclone with winds (a big fan) and shaking (haptic

It helps you size the window correctly and position the screen etc. It was my first time making a React component and I found the publishing quite difficult but I worked it out well: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sampoder/holocron>\n\nI then built a demo app that shows the status of your Vercel deployments on your headset. It uses SWR and react-reveal to make it feel buttery smooth!\n\nI also built one that implements the Slack events component on the Hack Club Website (here) on to it (sadly I ran out of time to put this in the demo vid but there are pics attached!\n\nHere's the GitHub project for the package: <https://github.com/sampoder/holocron>.\n\nAnd here's the demo video which I submitted to MLH's weekly hackathon...... and guess what?? Somehow, I won Best Overall Hardware Hack so I now get a free kit from ironically DigiKey (you still owe me money, no escaping) but my react component won best hardware hack lol!","attachments":[{"id":"attaR2qt0krVt4s1U","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/366b1c2deb7a625ad7b00a06ff7146bc/06ee9d7f/screenshot_2020-12-28_at_2.02.57_am.png","filename":"screenshot_2020-12-28_at_2.02.57_am.png","size":1095190,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/4afd013795b0b2b59eb739eb6ee23119/59b24c87","width":47,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/97fe04408f4052abec4812b4d6439373/b00264c9","width":673,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/6be5346b2219abf4b18fc52e664d6e62/6f7b4fa3","width":3000,"height":3000}}},{"id":"attTYqJE5IvnFiCDT","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/bd6a184befd9aeda6095d87c80e95768/437cb869/screenshot_2020-12-28_at_2.03.10_am.png","filename":"screenshot_2020-12-28_at_2.03.10_am.png","size":2326269,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/5d27ac0a4f707aea0e8d4a3304713af1/8426f2bd","width":52,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/6ec26e3f625d1d01bfa17d78f65b4e79/bc62bafc","width":742,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/6b70dee713a6beb07188c9ff816f7ba9/5b7e53dc","width":3000,"height":3000}}},{"id":"attVBUQzqZYBHL7XD","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/0e78cc84b1bcc2c618127b7c9b61514e/fec2a3fd/holocron__build_custom_apps_for_the_jedi_challenges_headset.mp4","filename":"holocron__build_custom_apps_for_the_jedi_challenges_headset.mp4","size":12696870,"type":"video/mp4"}],"mux":["02Gh2ZIX00KTpAWM3p5wPQYM6n3YScgOSOgQpLyA0190001Q"],"reactions":[{"name":"wom","url":"https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM/wom/38f68db963cab27b.png"},{"name":"vercel","url":"https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM/vercel/b3068754b6a5e6fa.png"},{"name":"christmas_tree","char":"🎄"},{"name":"react","url":"https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM/react/59d8043a7cfc8082.png"},{"name":"slack","url":"https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM/slack/7d462d2443.png"},{"name":"video_game","char":"🎮"},{"name":"github","url":"https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM/github/205ecaff62a0b210.png"},{"name":"hardware","url":"https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM/hardware/38550f0e8e8a73cc.png"},{"name":"goose-honk-technologist","url":"https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM/goose-honk-technologist/e771db0dddb5fd1e.png"},{"name":"sam-1","url":"https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM/sam-1/07c0196ed031d8a4.png"},{"name":"ship","char":"🚢"},{"name":"awesome","url":"https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM/awesome/134abff33c7abe7b.png"}]},{"id":"recoElQSwKXuvlv52","user":null,"timestamp":"1609048235.177500","slackUrl":"https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C01504DCLVD/p1609048235.177500","postedAt":"2020-12-27T05:50:35.177Z","text":"got hack club slack onto my jedi challenges headset!

based on what the model felt\n\nit’s not at all accurate but it’s fun!\n\nsource: <https://github.com/sampoder/dance-x-factor>\ntry: <https://dance1.innovweek.co/> (note: this is designed to only be used by one client so if multiple people use it 💥 )\n\nthis was a fun thing to make, tho it contained me dancing in a public library very quietly to train an ml model… have fun!! and ignore my 1am dancing","attachments":[{"id":"attOoZ1BURhzCdhcC","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ffc45221385aac58ca2bee9ab326edca/83ab644b/screen_recording_2020-12-23_at_12.32.11_am.mov","filename":"screen_recording_2020-12-23_at_12.32.11_am.mov","size":60169439,"type":"video/quicktime"}],"mux":["8fWVvwZwyxIx302sGJATMSCoObtgCuBQpWY122oOVnxE"],"reactions":[{"name":"wom","url":"https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM/wom/38f68db963cab27b.png"},{"name":"video_game","char":"🎮"},{"name":"goose-honk-technologist","url":"https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM/goose-honk-technologist/e771db0dddb5fd1e.png"},{"name":"js","url":"https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM/js/0772a31af766713b.png"},{"name":"github","url":"https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM/github/205ecaff62a0b210.png"},{"name":"sparkling_heart","char":"💖"},{"name":"watermelon","char":"🍉"},{"name":"ship","char":"🚢"},{"name":"sam-1","url":"https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM/sam-1/07c0196ed031d8a4.png"},{"name":"sauropod","char":"🦕"},{"name":"school_satchel","char":"🎒"},{"name":"awesome","url":"https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM/awesome/134abff33c7abe7b.png"}]},{"id":"recLqLhl58u07jbMN","user":null,"timestamp":"1608643593.370100","slackUrl":"https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0131FX5K98/p1608643593.370100","postedAt":"2020-12-22T13:26:33.370Z","text":"I

How it worked that there were teams placed in secret locations and they had to go through a series of challenges to reach the \"final location\" on the other side of the island which was the Merlion in Marina Bay but they didn't know that.\n\nHere's how it worked:\n\nEach team had 4 council members and one council leader. The council members were each given a store number that they had to go to in he Yishun Mall. Then the council leaders were all separated from their team together at Yishun Station. To come together they need to communicate through their location with only emoji.\n  \nThen once they have met, they receive a cryptic message: `My name is TRY***PA, call me maybe?` . When they type this word into their phone, it will call me. I then read out the following message: `1°21'53.2\"N 103°50'27.8\"E, but bigger.`\n\nIf you head to 1°21'53.2\"N 103°50'27.8\"E, you will yourself in a random carpark in Ang Mo Kio (Singaporean outskirt-ish suburb, very residential). But what is special about this random carpark, is that it is the site of a small Merlion statue pictured below (where you wouldn't really expect one, they're rare). And remember we wanted \"bigger\". So they now have to travel down to the main Merlion statue in Marina Bay racing against each other. On the way they had some fun tasks as well such as taking selfies, learning more about each other!\n\nFirst one there wins the race!!!! It went pretty well on the delay and despite some early hiccups the Academics Department team put their minds to it and won the race! How the completely skipped going into AMK by just use Google Street View 🤣 Diego got a big brain!!\n\nHere's a photo of the winning team and that infamous mini merlion as well some screenshots from Sherlock Holmes my alt account on Slack plus a make do TikTok that me and Anjali (VP) made coz neither of us have TikTok lol\n\nreally nice to have some fun!","attachments":[{"id":"attSCy0KmBr98cCvy","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ccf4e17bbc0144b3c2026938dfca978e/03b55abf/20201014_154057.jpg","filename":"20201014_154057.jpg","size":2176327,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/3bbccbc95e925836e8a1e646497b912b/336d2952","width":48,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/675bcab2d8fdcc9a9fd10bc306e24965/4f554526","width":683,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/ccf5f263ad197717dd1848c2e25b27ee/8b0e9924","width":3000,"height":3000}}},{"id":"attcr1L1r1EEQqA4L","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/8cb3249073fbeb3c2fdb9baf0d7be291/5c9cf2be/20201014_152537_1.mp4","filename":"20201014_152537_1.mp4","size":5468101,"type":"video/mp4"},{"id":"attPxWWZ4DuVUIsNa","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/5d28872982f9db13d4923c3114d129c6/ebfef7df/screenshot_2020-10-14_at_10.32.23_pm.png","filename":"screenshot_2020-10-14_at_10.32.23_pm.png","size":113148,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/ab8bd4435726a4573d7f19970134435e/09a5961a","width":184,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/57fda1eaf78c679b6849f3c7733ccc07/a0040c34","width":1706,"height":334},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/91e5ba448fa3d3bebe37f33672dbc1e9/4a683228","width":3000,"height":3000}}},{"id":"att2geXHO4agtJHPR","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/576cf657363cf09fdedb3d2626d63052/03f96fce/screenshot_2020-10-14_at_10.30.28_pm.png","filename":"screenshot_2020-10-14_at_10.30.28_pm.png","size":1837687,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/15693212666c83c8e9538da6440dd674/0d48ffb7","width":56,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/544cece467cbf4f936f1fa3cce237a9f/f71be51a","width":795,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/0f05d061d816cfba4b3d241f281546b3/9ef73a50","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"mux":["sQohroLfl8ELTrmJSSGYNsKVeseKp8FOgxabIRIUTf8"],"reactions":[{"name":"two_hearts","char":"💕"},{"name":"rocket","char":"🚀"},{"name":"ultrafastparrot","url":"https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM/ultrafastparrot/5148eb2f1db74d3b.gif"},{"name":"singaporeparrot","url":"https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM/singaporeparrot/e384b9bdf8b7cfcb.gif"},{"name":"sparkles","char":"✨"},{"name":"runner","char":"🏃‍♂️"},{"name":"google","url":"https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM/google/db268afe9280381b.png"},{"name":"slack","url":"https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM/slack/7d462d2443.png"},{"name":"ship","char":"🚢"},{"name":"flag-sg","char":"🇸🇬"},{"name":"raised_hands","char":"🙌"},{"name":"raised_hands","char":"🙌"},{"name":"raised_hands","char":"🙌"},{"name":"raised_hands","char":"🙌"},{"name":"smile","char":"😄"}]},{"id":"reciL97emUvk4nj7t","user":null,"timestamp":"1602596466.375800","slackUrl":"https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C019RMWTECD/p1602596466.375800","postedAt":"2020-10-13T13:41:06.375Z","text":"i went to chinatown tonight with my family!","attachments":[{"id":"atteKfHW4yXAhKpkv","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/c8882c9a851afdc08b1638f90af99fa3/f87c38df/20201013_194446.jpg","filename":"20201013_194446.jpg","size":457382,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/1fb6248047659e4e997684ba892d8dfd/a6638a69","width":27,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/0c3289ec9555ab7bd1a8797bf314afc2/d7751b2e","width":512,"height":683},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/d517973ae1a84c3e5c3fee880d3413c7/3bed5eeb","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"mux":[],"reactions":[]},{"id":"reccpYVqoyG0BuuHv","user":null,"timestamp":"1602595769.060800","slackUrl":"https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C01504DCLVD/p1602595769.060800","postedAt":"2020-10-13T13:29:29.060Z","text":"built a little thing!

Today my brother (Tom) and I headed down to Marina Bay / SportsHub Area to have some fun! We decided to do some kayaking 🛶 and now we're taking a two day course to get try our kayaking certification 📃 We kayaked around Marina Bay, it was really nice to kayak around Marina Bay Sands, the Gardens by the Bay and all the famous landmarks you'd associate with Singapore :singaporeparrot:\n\nWe then went to Popeyes, to grab some lunch which was yummy as always 😋 They had these really nice little ice cream cubes that we shared!\n\nThen we headed for a walk from the Stadium, heading up along the boardwalk and condos then to Marina Barrage and ending in Gardens by the Bay. (so basically walking around the reservoir we had gone kayaking on).\n\nThe first photo is of the water sports centre and the reservoir. The second is your famous Marina Bay group of buildings: Marina Bay Sans (the complex with 3 buildings and a boat on top), Gardens by the Bay (a new garden built next to the CBD), the Arts Science Museum (the white flower shaped building) and the Singapore Flyer 🎡. The third are the super trees at Gardens by the Bay, these are super cool fake trees. They are vertical gardens that house exotic plants, they collect rainwater for the garden, have solar panels to power their light displays and are engineering genius in my view 🌴 Then the fourth photo is of the CBD, with the gardens in the foreground. 🏢  The fifth is the National Stadium, which is the largest dome in the world, has a retractable roof and because Singapore is in the tropics a environmentally friendly bowl style cooling system that feels like air conditioning (trust me it's cool in their) but uses 15% of the energy. The sixth image is of the gardens again 🌻\n\nI hope you enjoyed my tour of Marina Bay, good night you all I'm tired 😴","attachments":[{"id":"attT0D5Bd4t74mqhW","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/91755797512e042f072466eeb46e34d7/bdd6b8e0/20200725_152426.jpg","filename":"20200725_152426.jpg","size":1677494,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/cc744618b860db748a3aa60042122a63/eafdefa5","width":48,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/32462a6a4ecd60110c57bf7f711590b2/f158cef7","width":683,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/bccb14feb1f63d234348997941cdec1d/d95fbb8c","width":3000,"height":3000}}},{"id":"attbHzP4fO8vtmZPf","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/1a2da6e37ed0833798d86c7dd20f745b/6ef0567c/20200725_080446.jpg","filename":"20200725_080446.jpg","size":1557092,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/a886867165335212a2b571110bee8d49/4d5a06d7","width":48,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/94643d559a7eda6255ef6af970e4335b/8c530bab","width":683,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/4dc3437afde80c34e4a62e0e32e1296b/06341a20","width":3000,"height":3000}}},{"id":"attpAXRczTDxUvpK8","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/2e2e0b6c5bc4566283a13be0d34f928d/c412cd2b/20200725_141148.jpg","filename":"20200725_141148.jpg","size":762731,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/ab485dc8ec8bf415ffbd5d5ddfc1e115/01084cb2","width":48,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/026cb8eea79131faef030cce95b4e90c/dd28c031","width":683,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/4806e13940e659bdf9d2a1a4b7cdaaf0/280c22f1","width":3000,"height":3000}}},{"id":"attwxArP9HBrQ0rn8","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/38d15eec589e4dea136339830491c0d2/03dc779b/20200725_152438.jpg","filename":"20200725_152438.jpg","size":1993947,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/34d9e30f95296c931cb750ac6e648951/696f4c09","width":48,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/44f86176edb07ce463c345b139961c35/8444350a","width":683,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/d55f0dc0f4a0fc4fe2a29321e01fac5d/10ba4db6","width":3000,"height":3000}}},{"id":"attxEmJG8C7BOjNF1","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/c20b2d02f828787835afd6b1ada54272/98931ec0/20200725_132748.jpg","filename":"20200725_132748.jpg","size":2301186,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/fcbb94dea7de9ab2a8735b9804d97064/25916340","width":48,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/3180ccbb42642decfe267ff1758f2d80/c864c735","width":683,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/957f344c0b11dc851330c9d48e3d72f0/3ef29e2c","width":3000,"height":3000}}},{"id":"attnt9BJKSipqLZsG","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/f26d398b7d099466b00e71f79d75e223/9e118542/20200725_151921.jpg","filename":"20200725_151921.jpg","size":2382922,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/25eea029110c32ec7804e042557eb03f/4a01acc8","width":48,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/2df4bf255cf4aa3b885285cff1cb8459/f0654d39","width":683,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/3f0a1de8582c5a222c8d96b9472dd9b9/c86bbce0","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"mux":[],"reactions":[{"name":"summer-of-making","url":"https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM/summer-of-making/d51b7cf2b0ee6489.png"},{"name":"canoe","char":"🛶"},{"name":"singaporeparrot","url":"https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM/singaporeparrot/e384b9bdf8b7cfcb.gif"},{"name":"camera","char":"📷"}]},{"id":"recZXq2urrzRXBtK4","user":null,"timestamp":"1595599447.283600","slackUrl":"https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C01504DCLVD/p1595599447.283600","postedAt":"2020-07-24T14:04:07.283Z","text":"CodeDay project is getting along well!!
